RVEtool is a modeling package with different tools for meshing and run FEA of micromechanical models based on fiber-reinforced materials including the presence of defects. The different packages are devised to run in High-Performance Computing environments.

  * `RVE_gen`: It contains `.npz` files which are generated by specific algorithms for the generation of RVEs.
  * `RVE_mesher`: [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info) as the main 2-d and 3-d finite element mesh generator with built-in pre processing facilities.
  * `RVE_solver`: [Alya multiphysics](https://www.bsc.es/research-development/research-areas/engineering-simulations/alya-high-performance-computational) as the main FEA solver for High-Performance Computing.
  
`RVE_gen` main features:
- Only `.npz` files are supported.

`RVE_mesher` main features:
- 3-d mesh with hexahedron elements.
- Generation of the full Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs) based on master-slave nodes (Garoz et al. 2019).
- Coordinates correction at boundary nodes for a correct application of PBCs.
- Option to generate zero-thickness cohesive elements between fibers and the matrix.

`RVE_solver` main features:
- Sequential (`ASCII`) format or parallel I/O (`MPIO`).
- Parallel mesh partitioning.
- Iterative solvers for symmetric and unsymmetric matrices.
- ...
